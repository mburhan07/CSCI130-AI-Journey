# CSCI 130 - AI Journey

## Week 1 Project: Hello AI World

### Description
A simple Python program that demonstrates basic AI agent concepts from Chapter 2.
The program greets the user, asks about their mood, and responds using simple rules.

### Features
- Time-aware greetings (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Simple conversation responses based on mood keywords
- Random AI facts about real-world AI usage

### How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3.9 or higher is installed.
2. Open a terminal in this repository folder.
3. Run: `python hello_ai.py`
4. Follow the prompts in the terminal.

### What I Learned
This week I learned how to install Python, use VS Code, and connect my code to GitHub.
I also learned how a basic reflex agent works by responding to different user inputs.

### Challenges
At first it was confusing to set up Git and clone the repository, but after following the steps a few times it made more sense.
I also had to fix a small error in my Python code, which helped me understand how to read error messages.
